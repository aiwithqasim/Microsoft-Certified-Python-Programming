<h1> (MICROSOFT) Introduction to Programming Using Python<h1>

<h3>About Test</h3>
The test comprises 40 questions to be completed in 45 minutes. Some of the questions are too lengthy and there can be short sub-questions in a question. So, you need to be very fast while attempting this test.

<h3>Syllabus</h3>
